        "## Why MNIST?\n",
        "- **Simple task**: Allows us to focus on ACT mechanics, not task complexity\n",
        "- **Fast training**: 5-10 minutes instead of hours\n",
        "- **Clear patterns**: Different digits should need different computation depths\n",
        "- **Easy debugging**: Can visualize and understand everything\n",
        "\n",
        "## Expected Behavior\n",
        "- Simple digits (1, 7) should halt early (1-2 iterations)\n",
        "- Complex digits (8, 9) should need more iterations (3-4)\n",
        "- The model should learn this pattern automatically through RL\n"
